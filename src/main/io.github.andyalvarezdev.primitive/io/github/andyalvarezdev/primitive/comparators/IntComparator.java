/**
 * <p>
 * A comparison function, which imposes a <i>total ordering</i> on some
 * collection of objects.  Comparators can be passed to a sort method (such
 * as {@link java.util.Collections#sort(List, Comparator)}  Collections.sort} or {@link
 * java.util.Arrays#sort(Object[], Comparator) Arrays.sort}) to allow precise control
 * over the sort order.  Comparators can also be used to control the order of
 * certain data structures, or to provide an ordering for collections of
 * objects that don't have a {@link Comparable natural ordering}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The ordering imposed by a comparator c on a set of elements
 * S is said to be <i>consistent with equals</i> if and only if
 * c.compare(e1, e2)==0 has the same boolean value as
 * e1.equals(e2) for every e1 and e2 in
 * S.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an
 * ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map).
 * Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an explicit comparator c
 * is used with elements (or keys) drawn from a set S.  If the
 * ordering imposed by c on S is inconsistent with equals,
 * the sorted set (or sorted map) will behave "strangely."  In particular the
 * sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general contract for set (or
 * map), which is defined in terms of equals.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, suppose one adds two elements {@code a} and {@code b} such that
 * {@code (a.equals(b) && c.compare(a, b) != 0)}
 * to an empty {@code TreeSet} with comparator {@code c}.
 * The second {@code add} operation will return
 * true (and the size of the tree set will increase) because {@code a} and
 * {@code b} are not equivalent from the tree set's perspective, even though
 * this is contrary to the specification of the
 * {@link IntSet#add Set.add} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators to also implement
 * java.io.Serializable, as they may be used as ordering methods in
 * serializable data structures (like {@link TreeIntSet},
 * {@link TreeIntObjectMap}).  In
 * order for the data structure to serialize successfully, the comparator (if
 * provided) must implement Serializable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For the mathematically inclined, the <i>relation</i> that defines the
 * <i>imposed ordering</i> that a given comparator c imposes on a
 * given set of objects S is:<pre>
 *		{(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) &lt;= 0}.
 * </pre> The <i>quotient</i> for this total order is:<pre>
 *		{(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) == 0}.
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * It follows immediately from the contract for compare that the
 * quotient is an <i>equivalence relation</i> on S, and that the
 * imposed ordering is a <i>total order</i> on S.  When we say that
 * the ordering imposed by c on S is <i>consistent with
 * equals</i>, we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence
 * relation defined by the objects' {@link Object#equals(Object)
 * equals(Object)} method(s):<pre>
 *	  {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. </pre>

	 * The implementor must ensure that sgn(compare(x, y)) ==
