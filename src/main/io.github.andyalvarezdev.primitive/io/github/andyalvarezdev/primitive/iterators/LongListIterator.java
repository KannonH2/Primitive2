/**
 * <p>
 * An iterator for lists that allows the programmer
 * to traverse the list in either direction, modify
 * the list during iteration, and obtain the iterator's
 * current position in the list. A ListIterator
 * has no current element; its <I>cursor position</I> always
 * lies between the element that would be returned by a call
 * to previous() and the element that would be
 * returned by a call to next().
 * An iterator for a list of length n has n+1 possible
 * cursor positions, as illustrated by the carets (^) below:
 * <PRE>
 * Element(0)   Element(1)   Element(2)   ... Element(n-1)
 * cursor positions:  ^            ^            ^            ^                  ^
 * </PRE>
 * <p>
 * Note that the {@link #remove} and {@link #set(long)} methods are
 * <i>not</i> defined in terms of the cursor position;  they are defined to
 * operate on the last element returned by a call to {@link #next} or {@link
 * #previous()}.
 * </p>
 * This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
